# Airline-Departure-Timing

# Introduction
The United Airlines direct flights into Syracuse (SYR) from four cities are the subject of this project. The aim is to predict if each flight's arrival time into SYR will be early, on-time, delayed, or severely delayed, 1-4 days in advance. There are no restrictions on the data sources, and weather predictions for the next few days can be considered, as weather is one factor that can cause airline delays. The final predictions will be made on a CSV file with a column for predicting the arrival time, date (April 21-24 to be predicted on April 20), origin airport, and flight number. Ground truth data will be based on the United Airlines website, where flights that are more than 10 minutes early will be considered early, within 10 minutes (plus or minus) of the scheduled time will be considered on-time, more than 10 minutes late but up to 30 minutes late will be considered late, and anything beyond 30 minutes late will be considered severely late. Any approach using regression or classification, including statistical analysis and time series, would be reasonable choices for the methodology, but neural networks or deep learning-based methods are not allowed.
